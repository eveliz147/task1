# FBB-PRIDE

We are participants of PH Bio Hackathon 2021
Our team is from Lomonosov Moscow State University

Our team's aim was to create a model to predict protein solubility!

A picture below  represents steps of our solution

We first make some preprocessing of PDB files: removing HETATOM, re-numerating residue ids, calculating dssp and sasa, finding exposed amino acids on surface area.
